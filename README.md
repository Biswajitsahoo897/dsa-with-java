# DSA with Java — Linked List

A curated collection of data structures and algorithm implementations in Java, focused on teaching and practicing fundamentals with clean, easy-to-read code.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Biswajitsahoo897/dsa-with-java.git
```

2. Move into the linked-list folder:
```bash
cd dsa-with-java/linkedlist
```

3. Compile and run any Java file:
```bash
# Compile a single file
javac FileName.java

# Or compile all Java files in the folder
javac *.java

# Run (use the class name that contains main)
java FileName
```

Notes:
- If your files are in packages, run javac from the repository root and use the fully-qualified class name with `java`.
- For larger projects consider using a build tool (Maven/Gradle) for compilation and dependency management.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen DSA & problem-solving fundamentals
- Build clean Java implementations
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Maintain a well-structured learning repository
